## MindfulNest
MindfulNest is a tool for preschool classrooms that teaches children emotion regulation techniques using both a tablet app and interactive robotic devices. I am worked as a researcher and assessed the prototype product. My favorite part of the project was collecting field data at local Pittsburgh preschools!

## No Edge No Chance
2024 NFL Big Data Bowl Finalist: Collaborating with CMU Football Head Coach Ryan Larsen and Defensive Coordinator Ben Gibboney, we proposed a quantitative definition and evaluation metric for the defensive concept of "setting the edge". We made an R Shiny app that gives coaches a team view of edge-setting directional performance.

## tAIylor's version
Text Analysis Project: We used modern language analysis methods to compare Taylor Swift lyrics from albums included in her Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. We fine-tuned a large language model to classify which album Taylor Swift lyrics come from. Next, we created tAIylor's version, a fine-tuned GPT-2 model that generates song lyrics in a style of writing similar to Taylor Swift! In doing so, we investigate the questions: Can AI be creative? Can AI write song lyrics?
