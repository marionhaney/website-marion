## Applying NFL Statistical Models to CMU Football
Sports Analytics Capstone Project: Our group analyzed & web-scraped DIII football data to model gameplay for the CMU football team. We evaluated defense and offense performance using both a play efficiency and expected points model and created a model for predicting the next scoring event.

## Sorting Hat Booth Game
Kappa Alpha Theta 2023 Booth, CMU Spring Carnival: I lead a team to design & develop a game inspired by the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter! The game is a CMU-themed personality test that sorts you into your Harry Potter house. We made a model of the movie Sorting Hat that talks and "thinks" while you take the test.

## MindfulNest
MindfulNest is a tool for preK classrooms that teaches children emotion regulation techniques using both a tablet app and physical interactive devices. During the 2022-2023 school year, the tool underwent a clinical trial in the Pittsburgh area. I have been cleaning and analyzing data from this trial to assess MindfulNest's effectiveness.
