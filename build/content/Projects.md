## Applying NFL Statistical Models to CMU Football
Sports Analytics Capstone Project: Our group analyzed & web-scraped DIII football data to model gameplay for the CMU football team. We evaluated defense and offense performance using both a play efficiency and expected points model and created a model for predicting the next scoring event.

## MindfulNest
MindfulNest is a tool for preK classrooms that teaches children emotion regulation techniques using both a tablet app and physical interactive devices. During the 2022-2023 school year, the tool underwent a clinical trial in the Pittsburgh area. I have been cleaning and analyzing data from this trial to assess MindfulNest's effectiveness.
