## Sorting Hat Booth Game
Kappa Alpha Theta 2023 Booth, CMU Spring Carnival: I lead a team to design & develop a game inspired by the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter! The game is a CMU-themed personality test that sorts you into your Harry Potter house. We made a model of the movie Sorting Hat that talks and "thinks" while you take the test.

## Snake Animation
For 60125: Introduction to 3D Animation Pipeline. Using Maya, Zbrush, I designed a snake character and animated a 15 second video. I modeled the movement after a sine wave and used several textures for the character and environment.
